Below is a structured technical assessment of grblHAL vs FluidNC with respect to your stated goals:

Your target feature set

Keep (or exceed) grblHAL’s advanced motion, probing, modularity.
Adopt FluidNC’s human-friendly external config files (YAML-style), not just $-settings.
Add true real-time (or near real-time) streamed configuration (incremental updates while system is live).
S-curve (jerk-limited) acceleration support (planner-level upgrade).
Advanced probing workflows (multi-surface mapping, tool length, auto squareness checks, scanning).
Good foundation for iterative development with Copilot (clean layering, clear abstractions, testability).
High-level comparison

Architecture / Modularity
grblHAL: Strong hardware abstraction layer. Each MCU driver isolates peripherals (timers, stepgen, IO, spindle, networking add-ons). Extension points exist for plugins (e.g., SD card, Ethernet, I/O expanders, PWM, encoder feedback).
FluidNC: Based on grbl_esp32 lineage; tightly coupled to ESP32 environment. Config and runtime loop integrated around FreeRTOS tasks with ESP-IDF specifics. Less portable.
Motion Control / Planner Capability
grblHAL: Mature planner derived from GRBL with extensions (segmented buffering, optional velocity and acceleration tweaks, probing refinements, multi-axis expansions). Some forks/plugins experimented with jerk or pseudo S-curve. Core tree emphasizes GRBL-style trapezoidal acceleration but has hooks for enhancement.
FluidNC: Uses improved scheduling on ESP32 and has some smoothing/jerk-like parameters (depending on branch), but classical GRBL concepts remain. True higher-order S-curve (7-phase) not fully realized; would still require planner rewrite or deep modification in either project.
Advanced Probing / Features Breadth
grblHAL: Rich set of probing cycle extensions, tool length offsets, multiple coordinate systems, optional plugin expansions (closed-loop experiments, encoder spindle sync, THC in some forks). Community more focused on feature density and extensibility.
FluidNC: Practical features for hobby/desktop machines; supports macros and probing basics. Advanced metrology or multi-point mesh leveling less standardized (often handled host-side or via macros).
Configuration System
grblHAL: Traditional $-settings persisted in EEPROM/flash (or NVS). Mostly scalar parameters; structured configuration (e.g., per-axis advanced constraints) requires code or plugin changes. Compile-time header configs for deeper hardware definitions. Not user-friendly for large structured configs.
FluidNC: YAML file defines pins, motors, kinematics, limits, networking, peripherals. Single source of truth loaded at boot; easier for end-users to reason about machine definition. Edits require restart (generally) but are accessible and versionable.
Real-time Configurability
grblHAL: Supports real-time overrides ($J jogging, feed/spindle overrides) and dynamic settings changes, but planner re-initialization for structural changes (e.g., steps/mm) requires caution and buffer flush.
FluidNC: Not truly streaming config; you edit the file, system reloads. Some runtime commands adjust parameters but not full dynamic reconfiguration of machine graph.
Neither: Provides full transactional streaming config application with dependency ordering, atomic validation, and rollback semantics out-of-the-box.
Portability / MCU Ecosystem
grblHAL: Broad MCU support (STM32 families, RP2040, Teensy, ESP32 variants, PIC32, etc.). Easier future-proofing and hardware diversity.
FluidNC: ESP32-centric. Ties you to Wi-Fi/Bluetooth rich environment but limits portability.
Codebase Maturity / Separation of Concerns
grblHAL: Cleaner layering (core motion, HAL driver, plugin surfaces). Good for injecting new config layer and planner upgrade.
FluidNC: Integrated config loader is a plus, but logic and board specificity intermixed; extracting features to a generalized multi-MCU environment is more work.
Community & Momentum (advanced experimentation)
grblHAL: Attracts developers wanting to push beyond basic GRBL (e.g., closed-loop, expansion axes, network protocols).
FluidNC: Attracts users needing quick setup and networked configuration on ESP32.
Licensing
Both are GPL/GPLv3 lineage (verify exact SPDX headers in chosen commits). Combining code will keep you in GPLv3 territory for distribution of binaries + source obligations. No incompatibility between them, but you must publish source for distributed derivatives.
Risk / Technical Debt
Adding a YAML/dynamic config system to grblHAL: Moderate complexity but conceptually clean.
Refactoring FluidNC to adopt grblHAL’s breadth of advanced modular features: High complexity (would amount to partial reimplementation).
Summary Matrix (qualitative)

Aspect | grblHAL | FluidNC Motion extensibility | Strong | Moderate Existing advanced probing | Strong | Moderate Planner mod hook points | Better | Adequate Config UX | Weak | Strong Runtime config streaming potential | High (needs layer) | Medium (tighter coupling) Portability | High | Low Modular HAL surfaces | Strong | Limited Effort to add missing piece (file+stream config) | Moderate | High (to add advanced/portable features) Best foundation for your hybrid goal | Yes | No

Conclusion grblHAL is the superior starting point. You will reach your target (advanced features + modern, external, streamable configuration) faster by layering a FluidNC-style configuration system onto grblHAL than by porting grblHAL’s feature depth into FluidNC’s ESP32-centric codebase.

Recommended Architecture Additions (on top of grblHAL)

Configuration Domain Model
Create a schema (YAML or TOML) mapping to:
Axes: id, steps_per_mm, max_rate, accel, jerk (future), limits, homing params.
Kinematics: cartesian/coreXY/delta (future).
IO Map: pins for step/dir/enable, coolant, spindle, probe, custom GPIO.
Motion Planner: segment buffer size, lookahead length, S-curve enable, jerk limits.
Probing Profiles: touch plate thickness, retract distances, multi-point pattern definitions.
Network/Protocol (if Ethernet/Wi-Fi plugin used).
Safety (watchdog, soft limits enable).
Provide version field + schema evolution support (semver).
Config Lifecycle Manager
Phases: Parse -> Validate -> Diff -> Dependency ordering -> Apply -> Commit -> Persist.
Maintain a shadow (staging) config object. Only commit once all sections validate.
Produce diff summary for host (JSON patch-style).
Streaming Update Protocol
Define new real-time channel messages (e.g., JSON frames over existing serial/Ethernet):
{ "type":"cfg_patch", "id":"abc123", "ops":[ { "op":"replace","path":"/axes/X/accel","value":750 } ] }
Controller responds with staged validation result; host sends commit or rollback.
Lock sequencing: Pause planner intake (not step output) when updating motion-critical values requiring recomputation (e.g., steps/mm). Flush planner queue if fundamental kinematic change.
Planner Upgrade for S-curve
Introduce new jerk-limited profile:
Option A: 7-phase S-curve generator (acc jerk pos, acc jerk neg, constant acc, cruise, dec jerk pos, dec jerk neg, constant dec).
Option B: Hybrid approach with discrete jerk limiting (limit dA/dt increments per planner cycle).
Abstraction:
AccelProfileStrategy interface: computeSegment(entry_state, target_state, constraints) -> segment(s)
Implement TrapezoidalStrategy (existing) and SCurveStrategy.
Add gating: Config parameter motion.planner_profile = trapezoidal | scurve, and jerk limits (axis jerk_max, global jerk_max_rate_of_change).
Advanced Probing Module
Provide a Probing Orchestrator:
Probe primitives: single-touch, multi-depth confirm, edge-find, grid sample.
Composable macro definitions stored in config (probe_profiles).
Safe state machine (idle -> arm -> move -> trigger -> retract -> record -> next).
Add data output structure (JSON) for host consumption (point clouds for surface mapping).
Safety & Atomicity Considerations
For dynamic changes to steps/mm or kinematics: require machine idle + planner empty; otherwise respond with a busy state requiring host retry or apply with flag "force_flush".
Provide transactional ID and rollback on any application failure.
Persistence
Store canonical YAML/TOML in flash/SD.
On boot: Load file -> Parse -> Hash -> Compare to stored last-applied config hash in NVS -> If mismatch apply migration hooks -> Load into runtime.
Export command to dump live reconciled configuration (including any runtime patches not yet persisted).
Test Strategy
Unit tests for: parsing, validation, diff application, rollback.
Simulation tests: apply rapid streaming patches while executing long path to ensure stability (should reject illegal mid-motion fundamental changes).
Motion profile numeric tests: compare trapezoidal vs S-curve timing and peak jerk.
Tooling & Developer Experience
Provide a config-lint CLI tool (same parser) so users catch schema errors before flashing.
Provide a sample migration script (v1 -> v2 mapping function library).
Gradual Integration Plan Phase 0: Fork grblHAL, set up CI, add abstraction layer for new configuration (without removing $-settings). Phase 1: Implement static file-based YAML load at boot, map to existing $ parameters. Phase 2: Add diff engine + streaming protocol (read-only dry-run first). Phase 3: Allow safe dynamic application for non-critical parameters (feed overrides, accel, jerk). Phase 4: Introduce S-curve strategy behind feature flag; verify equivalence for trapezoidal when disabled. Phase 5: Implement advanced probing orchestrator + config-driven probe profiles. Phase 6: Harden atomicity, add rollback and persistence hashing. Phase 7: Deprecate direct $ modifications for parameters covered by config (or keep compatibility layer translating $ to config patches).
Potential Challenges & Mitigations

Planner state corruption during updates: Use a PlanningStateGuard RAII pattern to pause enqueue, wait for buffer drain where necessary.
Increased memory footprint (parsing, staging config) on smaller MCUs: Provide build-time option MINIMAL_CONFIG that omits streaming/diff, only static load.
Latency of streamed patches: Batch ops and compute validation graph (e.g., axis parameter interdependencies) once per patch set.
Schema creep: Enforce strict unknown-key policy (warn or reject), maintain documented schema versioning.
Using Copilot Effectively Suggested iterative Copilot prompts (examples):

"Generate a C module that parses a minimal YAML subset into a key-value tree (string, int, float, bool). No dynamic allocation beyond a preallocated arena."
"Implement a diff function that compares two configuration structs (axes, planner, probing) and emits a list of changed fields."
"Add an abstraction AccelProfileStrategy with function compute_profile() and plug in existing trapezoidal planner as default implementation."
"Create a jerk-limited S-curve segment generator returning time-sliced velocity targets given max jerk, accel, velocity constraints."
"Implement a probing state machine with events: ARM, MOVE, TRIGGER, RETRACT, COMPLETE, ERROR; provide callbacks for motion request and trigger detection."
"Write unit tests for applying a config patch that changes X axis acceleration while a motion queue is active; expect rejection."
Metrics for Success

Mean time to apply safe config patch: < 50 ms for non-critical changes.
Planner throughput unchanged (or <5% penalty) when using trapezoidal with new abstraction layer.
Jerk-limited profile maximum overshoot vs requested velocity <1%.
Probing repeatability within mechanical probe spec (e.g., <= 0.01 mm std dev) demonstrated in log output.
Recommendation Start from grblHAL and layer:

External structured configuration system (YAML/TOML + schema + mapping).
Streaming diff-based config patch protocol.
Planner abstraction and S-curve insertion.
Advanced probing orchestrator referencing config-defined probe profiles.
FluidNC’s configuration ergonomics are worth emulating, but porting its model into grblHAL’s more modular and feature-rich base is the lower overall complexity path.
