# FluidNC vs grblHAL: Technical Assessment for Custom CNC Firmware Development

**grblHAL emerges as the superior foundation for custom firmware development**, particularly when advanced motion control and real-time performance are priorities. However, the optimal strategy involves hybridizing both architectures to capture grblHAL's technical superiority while incorporating FluidNC's innovative configuration approach.

## Architecture and Codebase Analysis

### grblHAL: Superior Technical Foundation

grblHAL demonstrates exceptional software engineering through its **Hardware Abstraction Layer (HAL) architecture**, enabling support for 15+ MCU families including STM32, ESP32, Teensy, and RP2040. The codebase separates hardware-specific implementations from core GRBL logic through function pointer-based abstractions:

```c
typedef struct {
    bool (*driver_init)(void);
    void (*stepper_pulse_start)(stepper_t *stepper);
    spindle_hal_t spindle;
    coolant_hal_t coolant;
    // Platform-agnostic interfaces
} hal_t;
```

This architecture enables **400kHz+ step rates** on high-performance platforms like Teensy 4.1, compared to ESP32's inherent limitations. The modular plugin system allows feature additions without core modification, using runtime function pointer redirection for extensibility.

### FluidNC: Modern Configuration Excellence

FluidNC's **YAML-based configuration system** represents a revolutionary approach to CNC firmware configuration, eliminating recompilation requirements:

```yaml
axes:
  x:
    steps_per_mm: 800
    max_rate_mm_per_min: 2000
    motor0:
      stepstick:
        step_pin: gpio.12
        direction_pin: gpio.14
```

The ESP32-specific architecture leverages advanced hardware features including **RMT peripheral stepping** and **I2S output drivers** for GPIO expansion, while supporting runtime configuration modification through `$` commands and WiFi-based web interfaces.

## Motion Control Capabilities Assessment

### S-curve Acceleration: grblHAL's Critical Advantage

**grblHAL has fully implemented 3rd-order jerk control** with configurable jerk parameters ($800, $801, etc.) providing true 7-segment S-curve acceleration profiles. This implementation demonstrates **measurable improvements in surface finish quality** and mechanical stress reduction during milling operations.

**FluidNC completely lacks S-curve acceleration**, utilizing only traditional trapezoidal profiles with linear acceleration ramps. This represents a fundamental limitation for precision machining applications.

### Probing Features Comparison

Both systems support comprehensive **G38.2-G38.5 probing commands**, but with different strengths:

**grblHAL advantages:**
- Advanced tool length offset (TLO) management with automatic calculation
- G59.3 coordinate system for repeatable tool measurements
- Integration with M6 tool change sequences
- Plugin-extensible architecture for custom probing workflows

**FluidNC advantages:**
- Simplified YAML-based probe configuration
- Built-in dual-speed probing macro support
- Integrated safety features with check_mode_start validation
- Web-based probe result visualization

## Configuration System Analysis

### FluidNC's Revolutionary Approach

FluidNC's YAML configuration system enables **real-time parameter modification** without firmware recompilation:

- **Runtime modification**: `$/axes/x/steps_per_mm=80` changes parameters in volatile memory
- **Configuration streaming**: Multiple config files switchable via `$Config/Filename=<file.yaml>`
- **Web interface integration**: Browser-based configuration editor at fluidnc.local
- **Validation system**: Comprehensive error checking with detailed startup messages

### grblHAL's Traditional Approach

grblHAL uses hierarchical $ settings with plugin support, requiring compilation for major architectural changes but supporting:

- **Plugin settings**: Dynamically allocated setting ranges
- **External storage**: EEPROM/FRAM plugin support with 100 trillion write cycles
- **Web Builder**: Browser-based firmware configuration eliminating local toolchain requirements

## Real-time Configuration Capabilities

### FluidNC: Superior Runtime Flexibility

FluidNC excels in runtime configuration modification through:
- **Extensive $ command support** for real-time parameter changes
- **WiFi-based configuration streaming** without physical connections  
- **Hot-swapping capabilities** between stored configuration files
- **Persistent storage** in ESP32 LITTLEFS filesystem

### grblHAL: Limited Runtime Modification

grblHAL provides basic runtime tuning through traditional $ settings but requires firmware recompilation for major configuration changes, though the Web Builder tool simplifies this process.

## Hardware Platform Support and Performance

### grblHAL: Multi-Platform Excellence

**15+ supported MCU families** including:
- **STM32 series**: F1xx through H7xx with varying performance levels
- **High-performance platforms**: Teensy 4.1 (600MHz, 400kHz+ step rates)
- **ESP32**: Full networking capabilities with >300kHz performance
- **RP2040**: Raspberry Pi Pico/PicoW support

### FluidNC: ESP32-Exclusive Optimization

**ESP32-only support** with sophisticated hardware utilization:
- **Dual-core architecture**: Core 0 for communications, Core 1 for real-time motion
- **RMT engine**: Hardware-assisted stepping with 15-bit timing precision
- **I2S output**: GPIO expansion through shift registers for pin multiplexing
